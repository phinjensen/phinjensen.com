It's been a year since my [2023](blog/2023/favorites-of-2023/) year-end favorites roundup. Here's my favorite stuff from 2024!

## Favorite Podcasts I Discovered

- [No Such Thing as a Fish](https://www.nosuchthingasafish.com/) is a hilarious trivia podcast where four quiz show researchers each share their favorite fact of the week. Only four facts per episode? Sort of—after each person shares their fact, the rest of them share facts that they found related to the seminal fact. These are interesting and enlightening (and usually way too specific to help me in at my local library's trivia nights), usually funny, and the hosts are just a delight to listen to. I'm clearly late to find them, as the latest episode when I started listening was the episode 530, but that just means I've got a huge, fun backlog to catch up on. I've listened to every episode since as they've come out, and I've loved every one.
- [History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps](https://historyofphilosophy.net/) hasn't caught me up quite like No Such Thing as a Fish, but it's still been a really pleasant surprise. I've never had much interest in philosophy at all, finding it annoying when people bring up Plato and Socrates etc., but I've always felt like I *should* learn more about them. This podcast has been a great way to learn the history of philosophy so far, and it's delightfully easy to listen to: each episode is about 20 minutes and the author/narrator, Peter Adamson, is never stuffy or boring. It's a fun listen.

- [Slay the Spire](https://backloggd.com/games/slay-the-spire/)

## Favorite Technologies I Discovered

- [fzf's command-line keybindings](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#key-bindings-for-command-line) — I think I've been using fzf (a fuzzy-finding tool) for a while now, but learned about its command line keybindings this year which have been incredibly useful. I used to edit or view files with a command like `less $(fzf)`, but those characters are a bit of a pain to type and it didn't save the file I looked up in my shell history. The `CTRL-T` keybinding, when configured, makes it a much nicer interface, so I instead type `less `, then press `CTRL-T`, find the file I want, and hit `ENTER` and I've got the command with the filename filled out. Shell history-friendly!
- [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/) has helped me find and use a bunch of cool plugins for NeoVim that I might not have used (or properly configured) otherwise, for features such as auto-complete, Treesitter, a fancy file explorer (with good hotkeys!), project management (which I find mostly useful for maintaining a consistent root directory), integrated terminals, indent guides, and code context. There are some issues with LunarVim and a decent chunk of configuration I had to change, so I might not keep it forever, but it's been a great discovery tool at the very least.

## Favorite Articles I Read

- [The Four Hobbies, and Apparent Expertise](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2023/04/20/hobbies.html) — Marc Brooker shows that each hobby can be split into four sub-hobbies: doing the hobby, doing stuff with the _equipment_ used in the hobby, discussing the hobby, or discussing the equipment. I think I've way too often been guilty of being mostly in the discussing parts. I think I've spent more time looking at lenses I could by for my Zenit-E camera than actually taking pictures with it, and that's pretty lame. I don't think the meta-hobbies are actually a _problem_, but personally I want to be someone who is in the "doing the hobby" quadrant. I find that to be much more rewarding, but less automatic for me. This article has made me consider my own hobbies a lot more.
- [95%-ile isn't that good](https://danluu.com/p95-skill/) — An exploration of the idea that it's probably easier to be in the top 5% of people who do some thing that it might seem, as long as you genuinely want to improve and seek opportunities to improve. Coaching is also explored as a very valuable tool. I think I would benefit from a more careful approach to improving my own skills, especially with outside feedback.

## Favorite New Experience

- Being a father. My daughter is now 9 months old and it's been a rollercoaster: incredibly joyous, to equally difficult, back to joyous in very short periods of time. I love it, though, and I wouldn't trade it for anything. It's hard, though.
