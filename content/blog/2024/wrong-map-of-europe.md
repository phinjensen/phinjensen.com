I recently came across this map of Europe in a Discord memes channel:

![map of Europe with many strange problems](/blog/2024/wrong-map-of-europe/original.jpg)

At first glance, it didn't seem to be anything special, but why was it posted in a _memes_ channel? I took a closer look. Even if you're not super familiar with European geography, you'll probably find something... _off_ about it. Or many things.

After finding a lot of discrepancies from my own memory of European maps, I decided to try to catalog every single problem with the map and found way more issues than I expected. I think it's very likely I missed some things as well, so please [email me](mailto:phin@zayda.net) if you find more issues. I'll update the list and give you credit (or keep it anonymous if you'd prefer).

To make it a little easier to see where each issue is, I've marked the map according to the grid made by the solid latitude and longitude lines:

![map of Europe with many strange problems and annotations for sections made by latitude and longitude lines](/blog/2024/wrong-map-of-europe/annotated.png)

(Pardon the low quality, the original I saw was already riddled with JPEG artifacts.)

## The "solution"

### A1

- "[Muktuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muktuk)" is not a city in Greenland
- Svalbard is a real place, but it's directly north of Norway (and much farther north). The island marked as Svalbard is called Jan Mayen
- Iceland is rotated 180 degrees
- "Faroe Islands (ICELAND)" don't exist
- The arctic circle doesn't pass through the mainland of Iceland[^9]
- Reykjavík is in the wrong place on the island anyway
- The capital of the Faroe Islands is Tórshavn - it's correct on the fake islands, but wrong on the real ones
- Havntors isn't a real place
- The "Sheltie islands" are actually called Shetland or the Shetland islands

### A2

- Glasgow, Edinburgh, Manchester, Liverpool, London, Belfast, and Oxford are all in the wrong place (Aberdeen and Mousehole are the only correctly placed and named cities in the UK)
- [Laphroaig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laphroaig_distillery) is not a city in the UK (although it is correctly placed)
- Leeds is misspelled as Leads (although it would be in the right place)
- Gerrard, UK and Neville, UK, don't exist. They are references to [Steven Gerrard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gerrard) and [Gary Neville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville), who played for Liverpool FC and Manchester United, respectively, though each "city" is located at the position of the one the other person played for.[^4]
- Bringmeham, UK doesn't exist (probably an intentional misspelling of Birmingham)
- Wales is a country in the UK, not a city (though it's in roughly the right place)
- The island marked "York (U.K.)" is actually called Guernsey
- Belfast, UK is listed as "Belslow"
- The island of Ireland is farther north than it should be[^8]
- The Hebrides islands should be off the coast of Scotland, not Ireland[^11]
- Ireland is called South Ireland instead of just Ireland (a reference to the country in the UK called "North Ireland")
- Dublin, Ireland is listed as "Belfast"
- [Duplo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Duplo), Ireland doesn't exist (and Dublin should be marked as the capital)
- There's no "[Goscinny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Goscinny)" in northwestern France
- Nantes, France is called "Fernantes"
- The Canary Islands are off the coast of Africa, not northwest of Spain
- The capital of the Canary Islands is called "Santa Cruz de Tenerife", and is abbreviated as "Santa Cruz", not "Tenerife"
- Catalonia is not an independent country. The part marked as Catalonia is roughly in the location of Basque Country, an autonomous region of Spain
- Sevilla is in the wrong place

### A3

- Lisbon should be where "Madrid" is marked in Portugal
- Madrid should be in central Spain
- Málaga is northwest of where it should be
- Valencia is farther south than it should be (it should be roughly where "Lisbon" is marked)
- Zaragoza is in northeast Spain, not on the southern coast
- Melilla and Ceuta are swapped (and Ceuta might be misspelled as Ceula)
- The sea between Spain and Morocco is called the Alboran Sea, not the Alderaan Sea
- Rabat looks too far north (although that could be a projection problem)

- "[Bokmål](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokm%C3%A5l)" and "[Nynorsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nynorsk)" aren't cities
