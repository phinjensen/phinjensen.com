In the last lesson, we successfully [rendered a wire mesh of a model](/blog/2022/rustyrender-bresenhams-line-drawing-algorithm), which was something I was pretty excited about. I've never done that before! Now, as someone who has absorbed some graphics knowledge through osmosis (playing games, hearing tech announcements, light reading, etc.) I know that our next step needs to be rendering filled triangles because 3D rendering is all based on triangles. That's actually something I had never wondered about until writing this post, but there's actually some [pretty interesting reasons](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6100615/7355242) that triangles are important in 3D graphics.

Drawing a triangle should be pretty easy, right?
