- Basics of porting the code
- Optimiziation strategies for Rust, and how I should have tested earlier
- Explanations of how the iterations of the algorithm work
  - disclaimer that I don't know what I'm talking about
- Porting the Model and Vec3 types (bare minimum)
- Porting the wireframe rendering code
  - Explanations (disclaimer again, of course)
