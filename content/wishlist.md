  - Something upon which I can place above soap in the shower out of reach of my dear sweet daughters, away from the glorious stream of warm water, with a surface that prevents the soap from adhering too strongly
- Headphones (I recently broke the right earbud of my headphones so that it won't charge):
  - [Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4](https://www.rtings.com/headphones/reviews/sennheiser/momentum-true-wireless-4) - low latency, good sound quality, water & dust resistance
  - Nothing Ear or Nothing Ear (a) - good sound quality, I had an earlier version that was buggy but I think the new ones are better
  - Jabra Elite 4 Active - what I have now, I like them, and they're pretty cheap right now
