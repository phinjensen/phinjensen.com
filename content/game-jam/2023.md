<h2 id="year">&nbsp;2023</h2>
</div>

Primbess Chombo's Raspberry Game Jam is an informal game jam hosted by [Phineas Jensen](/). Over the course of 5 days just after the new year, participants will conceptualize, design, and implement a video game from scratch. Not only should each game be conceived, designed, and implemented all within the 5 day span, but each entry should also fit the _theme_ of the game jam, which will be chosen at the beginning of the event. Of course, "fitting a theme" can mean a lot of things, and how _your_ game will do so is up to you to decide!

## When?

January 2-7, 2023

## How do I sign up?

If you want to participate, send an email to phin@zayda.net.

## Rules
1. Participation can be solo or in teams of up to 4 people.
2. Games must be started and finished within the time frame (that means no ideas/projects you already have). Using pre-made assets is okay.
3. Any game engine/framework/library/tool can be used.
4. Games should be clean (around the PG-13/TV-14/T rating).
5. All games must follow the theme somehow (up to interpretation, but make sure you can argue for it somehow).

|-----------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Kickoff Meeting**   | Jan. 2, 6:30 PM | Phin's apartment | To start things off, we’ll gather in-person, set up computers/laptops, have some snacks, and get our theme.                                               |
| **Go!**               | Jan. 2, 7:00 PM | Anywhere         | Time to get started! Now that you have a theme, start brainstorming ideas (with your team, if you have one) and get to work building a game.              |
| **Final Sprint**      | Jan. 7, 5:00 PM | Phin's apartment | Now that we're in the last few hours, feel free to come over to my place and we can all work together to the last minute.                                 |
| **Stop!**             | Jan. 7, 7:00 PM | Anywhere         | The jam is over! Don’t make any more code/design/asset changes, and build your project if you haven’t yet (bugfixes are okay if necessary).               |
| **Showcase & Awards** | Jan. 7, 7:30 PM | Phin's apartment | Each team will get to present their game to the rest. Afterwards, we'll all vote on what games should win what awards (just for fun, no prizes right now) |

## Game Engines/Frameworks

Here are a few suggestsions based on your preferred programming language or lack thereof. I haven't used most of these so I can't really vouch for them, but I've heard of them and heard good things about them, so they may be good starting points.Other options obviously exist, and you don't have to use any of these!

- C# - [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Godot](http://godotengine.org/)
- C++ - [Unreal](http://unrealengine.com/)
- Java - [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com/)
- JavaScript - [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/), [Phaser](https://phaser.io/)
- Python - [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/)
- Rust - [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/)
- No programming - [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en), [RPG Maker](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/) (may not be free!)

## I have questions/comments

Feel free to [email me](mailto:phin@zayda.net). Also, once you sign up you'll be invited to a Discord server where you can also ask questions.
