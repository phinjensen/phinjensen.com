title: "Hi, I’m Phineas"

I’m a computer science and linguistics student at Brigham Young University. I’ve been programming semi-professionally since I was 12 years old or so, and I’ve worked primarily with web technologies and languages, such as JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS. I also have experience with C, C++, and Rust; I’m excited about Rust especially.

My interest in linguistics is more recent: I studied several languages at a very surface level throught my childhood, and learned Persian (Farsi) and a bit of Turkish and Bulgarian as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Bulgaria. Learning these languages was so fun and exciting, I added linguistics as a second major shortly after returning to the US.

Right now I am:
- Taking a number of classes at BYU, including the engineering capstone class as a member of the university's Mars Rover comptetition team, where we are preparing to compete in the [2024 competition](https://urc.marssociety.org/).
- Working on [SeeYouLater](https://github.com/phinjensen/seeyoulater), a personal bookmarking app/server.

When I can find the time, I like to read or listen to books, run, hike, or otherwise exercise, play drums or guitar, or play video games. I also love spending time with my wife Alayna, who is much cooler than I am, and my beautiful baby daughter, who was born in 2023.
