title: "Hi, I’m Phineas"
---

I’m a husband, father of two girls, Christian, software engineer, recreational language-learner, and many other things. I work for Deloitte on public health software for state governments. I’ve been programming semi-professionally since I was a teenager, with most of my experience in JavaScript, Java, HTML, CSS, and SQL (specifically PostgreSQL, which I adore). I’ve been teaching myself Rust and Kotlin (for Android development) on the side.

I love languages and linguistics. I speak Persian, some Turkish, and I’m learning German.

Right now I am:
- Reading Sarah J. Maas’s _Throne of Glass_ series
- Trying to run more frequently (in the 5k range, though I ran a marathon a couple of years ago)
- Reading _[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)_ by Robert Nystrom and [following along](https://github.com/phinjensen/rlox) in Rust
- Occasionally contributing to open source projects

When I get free time, I like to read or listen to books, run, hike, or work out at the gym, learn trivia and look at maps, play guitar, play video games, or just spend time with my family.
