I’m a computer science and linguistics student at Brigham Young University. I’ve been programming semi-professionally since I was 12 years old or so, and I’ve worked primarily with web technologies and languages, such as JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS. I also have experience with C, C++, and Rust; I’m excited about Rust especially.

My interest in linguistics is more recent: I studied several languages at a very surface level throught my childhood, and learned Persian (Farsi) as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Bulgaria. I learned some Turkish and Bulgarian there as well, and added linguistics as a second major shortly after returning to the US.

Right now I'm taking four classes at BYU (Computer Science, Linguistics, and Biology), working on [SeeYouLater](https://github.com/phinjensen/seeyoulater), a personal bookmarking app/server, working at the BYU Internet Security Research Lab writing custom firmware for a hardware authenticator, and trying to improve my Persian. I'm also [preparing to be a father!](https://www.instagram.com/p/CkE6Cl5Jlng/) When I can find the time, I like to read or listen to books, run or otherwise exercise, play drums or guitar, or play video games. I also love spending time with my wife Alayna, who is much cooler than I am.
