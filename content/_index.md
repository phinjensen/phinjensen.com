title: "Hi, I’m Phineas"
---

I’m a husband, father of two girls, a Christian, a software engineer, a recreational language-learner, and many other things. I work for Deloitte on public health software for state governments. I’ve been programming semi-professionally since I was 12 years old or so, with most of my experience in JavaScript, Java, HTML, CSS, and SQL (specifically PostgreSQL, which I adore). I’ve been teaching myself Rust and Kotlin (for Android development) on the side.

I love languages and linguistics. I speak Persian, some Turkish, and I’m learning German.

Right now I am:
- Reading Sarah J. Maas’s _Throne of Glass_ series
- Working through Jeff Nippard’s _[The Essentials Program](https://jeffnippard.com/products/the-essentials-program)_
- Reading _[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)_ by Robert Nystrom and [following along](https://github.com/phinjensen/rlox) in Rust

When I get free time, I like to read or listen to books, run, hike, or work out at the gym, play guitar, play video games, or just spend time with my family.
