title: "Hi, I’m Phineas"
---

I’m a husband and father of two girls, a Christian, a software engineer, a recreational language-learner, and many other things. I work for Deloitte on public health software for state governments. I’ve been programming semi-professionally since I was a teenager, with most of my experience in JavaScript, Java, HTML, CSS, and SQL (specifically PostgreSQL, which I adore). I’ve been teaching myself Rust and Kotlin (for Android development) on the side.

I love languages and linguistics. I speak Persian, some Turkish, and I’m learning ~~German~~ Dutch.

Right now I am:
- Reading [A House Full of Females](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31812528-a-house-full-of-females) by Laurel Thatcher Ulrich
- Working on a [mini operating system](https://github.com/phinjensen/orca1000) in Rust, currently just a port of the [Operating System in 1,000 Lines](https://1000os.seiya.me/en/) book
- Playing Oldschool RuneScape to reignite my childhood passion for video games and obsession with the members-only content in the game

When I get free time, I like to read or listen to books, run, hike, or work out at the gym, learn trivia and look at maps, play guitar, play video games, or just spend time with my family.
