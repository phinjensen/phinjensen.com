# Hi, I'm Phineas

I'm a computer science and linguistics student at Brigham Young University. I've been programming semi-professionally since I was 12 years old or so, and I've worked primarily with web technologies and languages, such as JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS. I also have experience with C, C++, and Rust; I'm excited about Rust especially.

My interest in linguistics is more recent: I studied several languages at a very surface level throught my childhood, and learned Persian (Farsi) as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Bulgaria. I learned some Turkish and Bulgarian there as well, and added linguistics as a second major shortly after returning to the US.

Right now I'm studying, working at the BYU Department of Anthropology, working on porting an old [video game named KQ](https://github.com/phinjensen/kq-fork) to SDL, and trying to improve my Persian. When I can find the time, I like to read or listen to books, run or otherwise exercise, play drums or guitar, or play video games. I also love spending time with my wife Alayna, who is much cooler than I am.

I don't use social media much these days, but I do have a presence on several platforms:
