title: "Hi, I’m Phineas"
---

I’m a husband, father of two girls, a Christian, a software engineer, a recreational language-learner, and many other things. Right now I work for Deloitte, writing public health software. I’ve been programming semi-professionally since I was 12 years old or so, with most of my experience in JavaScript, Java, HTML, CSS, and SQL (specifically PostgreSQL, which I adore). I've been teaching myself Rust and Kotlin (for Android development) on the side, and I'd like to learn many, many more languages: Go, Haskell, Hare, and Gleam, to name a few.

This website has mostly been focused on technical subjects so far, and I imagine it'll continue to have a lot of technical subjects, but I'm interested in a lot more. Perhaps the most significant interest I have (enough to study it as a second major in college), is linguistics. I studied several languages at a very surface level throughout my childhood, and learned Persian (Farsi) and a bit of Turkish and Bulgarian as a missionary in Bulgaria for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Learning these languages was so fun and exciting, I added linguistics as a second major shortly after returning to the US.

Right now I am:
- Getting really interested in the FIRE movement (see [Mr. Money Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/))
- Working through Shaun T's [Insanity](https://www.shauntlife.com/insanity/) workout program with my wife
- Building a personal location-tracking app to share my location with my wife sans Google
- Playing some of the latest set of Teamfight Tactics

Other things I like to do:
- Read or listen to books
- Run/hike/or other exercise
- Play drums and guitar
- Play other video games
- Spend time with family
