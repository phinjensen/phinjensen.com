<h1 id="hi-im-phineas">Hi, I&rsquo;m Phineas</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m a computer science and linguistics student at Brigham Young University. I&rsquo;ve been programming semi-professionally since I was 12 years old or so, and I&rsquo;ve worked primarily with web technologies and languages, such as JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS. I also have experience with C, C++, and Rust; I&rsquo;m excited about Rust especially.</p>
<p>My interest in linguistics is more recent: I studied several languages at a very surface level throught my childhood, and learned Persian (Farsi) as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Bulgaria. I learned some Turkish and Bulgarian there as well, and added linguistics as a second major shortly after returning to the US.</p>
<p>Right now I&rsquo;m studying, working at <a href="https://www.endpointdev.com">End Point Corporation</a>, and trying to improve my Persian. When I can find the time, I like to read or listen to books, run or otherwise exercise, play drums or guitar, or play video games. I also love spending time with my wife Alayna, who is much cooler than I am.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use social media much these days, but I do have a presence on several platforms:</p>
